## What is Worldland?

Worldland is an EVM-compatible blockchain that uses [Error-Correction Code Proof-of-Work(ECCPoW)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2006.12306).

## Documentation
* Worldland Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.worldland.foundation/).

### TPM-gated research branch

This branch includes opt-in TPM enrollment and producer preparation integrated
into the client. It is not a mainnet-readiness or unrestricted-security claim.

- [Integrated client configuration and limits](docs/tpm-integrated-client.md)
- [Six-node real-vTPM campaign and result index](experiments/tgpow-gcp-full/README.md)
- [Korean experiment summary](experiments/tgpow-gcp-full/RESULTS-summary-ko.md)

Registration evidence is recorded on chain, but certificate/Certify validation
is performed by the assigned producers. Integrating their service into the node
does not make every full node independently redo all enrollment cryptography.
The6/6policy counts producer slots, not necessarily six distinct operators.
Deployment scripts are historical, environment-specific operations, not safe
one-command production setup. Raw DBs and private keys are not published.
